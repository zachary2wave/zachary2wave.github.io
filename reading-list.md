## Recent Reasearch Direction

研究方向

There are two point that i fellowed:

+ the one is the UAV-aid communtication.
We consider a scanerio where has a set of uav that need to  cooperate to finish some assignment. 
In this task, the UAV need to learning how to connet with each other to avoid the crash and mitigate interference through tarjectory design, power control, user assignment so on.  
+ the other is the resource allocation using Multi-agent reinforcement learning.
  As we all know,  the interference is a big problem that restrains the performance of wireless communication. For the shortage of wireless resource, improving the specture utilization through resource allocation is a feasible way.  However, the highly dynamic scenario  make the problem extremely difficulty. Treating every access point as a agent and designing the reward as the total QOE of every user equipment, the reinforcement learning can embed to control access point to improve the   proformance of whole network.



## Recent work

+ Build the web 
+ Contributing The chapter 10 of the [DeepLearning-500-questions](https://github.com/scutan90/DeepLearning-500-questions)
I will pubilshed on the website in the first place.
+ Write the using introduction for the project of [baseline](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
