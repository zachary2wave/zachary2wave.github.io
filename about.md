## The Blog of Xiangyu Zhang

Welcome.

I am a PHD student in Southeast University, majoring in Intelligent Communications. 

Here, you can find something awesome, maybe skills, projects, slides or papers, about wireless communication, signal processing, intelligence algorithm, which was accumulate in  in last 8 years, the time from undergraduate to PHD. Most of projects was programmed by MATLAB\Python.

I am now working on the combination of AI(reinforcement learning) and 5G or B5G, especially in UAV-aid communication and resource allocation in heterogeneous network(HetNet).

I have a faith that the future communication will revolutionize the human society and people's lifestyle. 

Good luck.
