# The Blog of Xiangyu Zhang

Welcome. The pages is *in* *construction*. But,  the recently works are available.    

I am a PHD student in Southeast University, majoring in Intelligent Communications. 

Here, you can find something awesome, maybe some skills, projects, slides or papers. These things are related to wireless communication, signal processing, intelligence algorithm, which were accumulate in last 8 years, the time from undergraduate to PHD. Most of projects was programmed by MATLAB\Python

I am now working on the combination of AI(reinforcement learning) and 5G or B5G, especially in UAV-aid communication and resource allocation in heterogeneous network(HetNet).

I have faith that the future communication will revolutionize the human society and people's lifestyle. 

Good luck.
