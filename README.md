# The Blog of Xiangyu Zhang

Welcome.

I am a PHD student in Southeast University, majoring in Intelligent Communications. 

Here, you can find something including some skill and project or paper that I have done in last 8 years after stepped electronic information engineering about wireless communication, signal processing, intelligence algorithm. 

The majority of them was programmed with MATLAB\Python 

I am now working on the combination of AI(reinforcement learning) and 5G or B5G, especially in UAV-aid communication and resource allocation in UDN

I have a faith that the future communication will revolutionize the human society and people's lifestyles. 

Good luck.
